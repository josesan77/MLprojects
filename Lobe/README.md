# MLprojects - Lobe Machine Learning software and model

[Lobe](https://www.lobe.ai/examples) is a user-friendly Machine Learning tool developed by Microsoft that enables users to create custom machine learning models without needing to write code. Lobe offers a drag-and-drop interface for training models, primarily focused on tasks like image classification. It automatically handles much of the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Training

Input Examples: Upload or record examples of the data you want to classify, such as images or text. In this situation images of apples were uploaded from two sets: for classification of fine/rotten apples, including test images.

Train the Model: Lobe automatically trains a machine learning model using the provided examples, requiring no manual configuration.

Export and Deploy: The trained model can be exported to formats compatible with platforms like TensorFlow, ONNX, or CoreML.

Applications:

Lobe is ideal for creating machine learning solutions in areas such as image classification, object detection, and text analysis. It is widely used for educational purposes, rapid prototyping, and integrating AI features into applications without extensive technical expertise.

Export Options: Trained models can be exported for use in web applications, mobile apps, or other projects. Tensorflow and TennsorFlow Lite (python) supported (2024/12) model files can be found in the corresponding subfolders.

Accessibility: Designed to make machine learning accessible to educators, students, and hobbyists, therefore easy to do the first step.

A powerful resource for quick prototyping and creative experimentation.
